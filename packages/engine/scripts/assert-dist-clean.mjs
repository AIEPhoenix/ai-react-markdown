/**
 * Fails the build if any executable dist artifact still references
 * `process.env`. Same invariant as core (see core/scripts/assert-dist-clean.mjs
 * for the full rationale): the dual dev/prod build must fold NODE_ENV at
 * build time — an unresolved reference would throw at import time in
 * no-bundler runtimes. Source maps are exempt: they embed original source
 * text and are never executed.
 *
 * Additionally load-bearing for THIS package: the engine is
 * framework-agnostic and runtime-agnostic by contract (plan §5) — a
 * `process` reference in dist would also break non-Node JS runtimes
 * (Hermes without polyfill, QuickJS).
