/**
 * Dev-only React hook that warns when a prop's reference identity changes
 * suspiciously often across renders — symptomatic of a caller that defined
 * the value inline instead of at module scope or behind `useMemo` /
 * `useCallback`. The wrapper of `<AIMarkdown>` uses this to flag
 * `urlTransform` and `sanitizeSchema` props that would otherwise silently
 * discard the per-block memo cache on every render.
 *
 * In production builds the entire warning logic is dead-code-eliminated:
 * the dual dev/prod build resolves `process.env.NODE_ENV` at build time
 * (tsup `env`), so `__DEV__` folds to a constant and the body's
 * `if (!__DEV__) return;` drops the rest. The single `useRef` allocation
 * remains (unconditional, by rules of hooks) but is harmless.
 *
 * History note: this module once gated on
 * `typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`,
 * which was silently FALSE in bundler browser dev — Vite substitutes only
 * the bare `process.env.NODE_ENV` text and leaves `typeof process`
 * evaluating `'undefined'` in the browser, so these warnings never fired
 * where they mattered most. Bare text everywhere + build-time resolution
 * is the fix; do not reintroduce `typeof process` guards.
 *
 * @module hooks/useReferenceFlipWarning
