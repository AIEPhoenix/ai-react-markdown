/**
 * Dev-only pipeline stage timing.
 *
 * The block-memo render path runs four distinct stages per content change
 * (parse → transform → build → render). Which one dominates depends on the
 * workload — plugin mix, document length, math density — and every
 * optimization decision should start from that split, not from a guess.
 *
 * Two delivery channels, deliberately separate:
 *
 * - **Programmatic consumers** (the BlockMemoCompare story's profiler)
 *   use {@link subscribeStageTimings} — a private, direct callback
 *   channel. It must NOT go through the User Timing API: React 19 dev
 *   builds emit one `performance.measure` per component render
 *   ("component tracks"), so a page-global 'measure' observer receives a
 *   flood of foreign entries it has to filter, and — measured — anything
 *   that scans or clears the buffer becomes O(buffer) with MILLIONS of
 *   entries in a long session.
 * - **DevTools timeline visibility**: {@link measureStage} still emits
 *   one `performance.measure` per stage, named
 *   `ai-markdown:stage:<stage>`. Emission is an append — cheap. It does
 *   NOT clear per name afterwards: Chromium's `clearMeasures(name)` scans
 *   the whole buffer, and under the React-dev flood that per-call scan
 *   cost ~35% of main-thread time ON THE INSTRUMENTED SIDE ONLY —
 *   inverting the very benchmark this instrumentation serves. Our own
 *   growth is ~4 entries per streamed token; the benchmark harness
 *   bulk-clears the buffer between runs (see useRenderProfiler.reset).
 *
 * Production builds fold {@link ENABLED} to `false`: the dual dev/prod
 * build resolves `process.env.NODE_ENV` at build time (tsup `env`), so
 * the published dist carries no env read at all; in-repo src consumers
 * (storybook, vitest) run under Vite/Node where the text is substituted
 * or `process` exists. The whole thing costs one boolean check per stage.
