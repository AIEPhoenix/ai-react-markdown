/**
 * Type definitions for the sealed engine plugin system (v2 input surface).
 *
 * An "engine plugin" is a first-class, core-exported description of one
 * configurable entry in the unified plugin chain. The five shipped plugins
 * replace the two v1.x enums (`AIMarkdownRenderExtraSyntax` /
 * `AIMarkdownRenderDisplayOptimizeAbility`) as the public way to select
 * optional parse-level capability.
 *
 * ## Why the set is sealed
 *
 * The incremental (prefix-freeze) parse engine's boundary scanner is
 * syntax-aware — it must know the boundary rules of every multiline
 * construct in the chain (see `computeFreezeBoundary`'s `defListEnabled`
 * option). Open plugin injection would void the engine's verification
 * record (50k-sample fuzz, direction batteries, byte equivalence), so
 * plugins are born where the certification rig lives: `packages/core`.
 * Wrappers curate (bundle default sets, filter, facade sugar); consumers
 * select. New parse-level capability lands via an upstream PR into core.
 * Third-party *content* extension stays open through `contentPreprocessors`
 * and `customComponents`.
 *
 * ## Seal mechanics
 *
 * The seal is a type-level contract and design declaration, not runtime
 * tamper-proofing — the same guarantee class as `Object.freeze`. The
 * `'~sealed'` marker key makes accidental construction a type error while
 * keeping the type structural, which is required for the type to remain
 * assignable across the package's two build entries (the root entry and
 * the `/plugins` subpath must stay mutually assignable whether or not the
 * build duplicates this declaration per entry; a `unique symbol` brand
 * would break the duplicated case. Current tsup output happens to share
 * one declaration chunk between the entries — an implementation detail
 * the seal deliberately does not lean on). A second, runtime gate
 * (`getEnginePluginInternals`, enforced in `sanitizeEnginePlugins`)
 * additionally rejects any object that lacks EITHER the marker or the
 * internal stage metadata, so a type-level forge is dropped at runtime
 * with a dev warning. Deliberately forging both keys voids the engine's
 * verification record.
 *

 * on the next addition. Feature-test with `Set`/`includes` instead.
